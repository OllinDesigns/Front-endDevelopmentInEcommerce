For the final project, you're aiming to have students integrate previous exercises into a functional e-commerce app. Let's outline the requirements step by step:

### Project Overview:
- **Objective**: Build a small e-commerce app displaying 4 product cards inside a product gallery and integrate a shopping cart where products can be added.
- **Components**:
  1. **Product Card**: Each product card should display product details such as image, title, price, and an "Add to Cart" button.
  2. **Product Gallery**: A gallery component to display the 4 product cards.
  3. **Shopping Cart**: A cart component where products can be added, displaying the selected items.

### Instructions for the Final Project:
1. **Structure**:
   - Students should start with their **ProductCard** component (from the previous exercises).
   - Create a **ProductGallery** component that renders four **ProductCard** components, each with different products.
   - Add a **ShoppingCart** component that displays products added from the **ProductGallery**.
   
2. **Responsiveness**:
   - The **ProductGallery** should adapt to different screen sizes using **Flexbox**.
   - Ensure the layout remains accessible and visually appealing on mobile and desktop devices.
   
3. **Accessibility**:
   - Ensure each product card and button is accessible using semantic HTML and ARIA attributes if necessary.
   - The **Add to Cart** button should be keyboard accessible and properly labeled.

4. **Cart Functionality**:
   - **Basic**: Allow students to implement simple add-to-cart functionality (using React's state to manage the items).
   - **Stretch Goal**: If they want to challenge themselves, they can introduce more advanced state management, but for now, basic React `useState` will be sufficient.

### Code Guidance (without revealing full solution):
1. **ProductCard Component** (in React):
   ```jsx
   const ProductCard = ({ product, addToCart }) => (
     <div className="product-card">
       <img src={product.image} alt={product.name} />
       <h2>{product.name}</h2>
       <p>{product.price}</p>
       <button onClick={() => addToCart(product)}>Add to Cart</button>
     </div>
   );
   ```

2. **ProductGallery Component**:
   ```jsx
   const ProductGallery = ({ products, addToCart }) => (
     <div className="product-gallery">
       {products.map((product) => (
         <ProductCard key={product.id} product={product} addToCart={addToCart} />
       ))}
     </div>
   );
   ```

3. **ShoppingCart Component**:
   ```jsx
   const ShoppingCart = ({ cartItems }) => (
     <div className="shopping-cart">
       <h2>Your Cart</h2>
       {cartItems.length === 0 ? (
         <p>Your cart is empty</p>
       ) : (
         cartItems.map((item) => (
           <div key={item.id}>
             <p>{item.name}</p>
             <p>{item.price}</p>
           </div>
         ))
       )}
     </div>
   );
   ```
