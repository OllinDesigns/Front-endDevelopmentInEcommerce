Here's a simple folder structure for a React project that includes `ProductCard`, `ProductGallery`, and `ShoppingCart` components. 

```
my-react-app/
│
├── public/                   # Contains static assets like index.html
│   └── index.html
│
├── src/                      # The source folder where all React code is
│   ├── components/           # Folder for all reusable components
│   │   ├── ProductCard.jsx   # The ProductCard component file
│   │   ├── ProductGallery.jsx # The ProductGallery component file
│   │   └── ShoppingCart.jsx  # The ShoppingCart component file
│   │
│   ├── App.jsx               # Main React component where all components are called
│   └── index.js              # Entry point, renders App component into index.html
│
├── package.json              # Contains project dependencies and scripts
└── README.md                 # Project description (optional, but useful)
```

### Explanation:

1. **public/index.html**:
   - This is the HTML file that serves as the root of your app. It will have a `div` with an ID (like `id="root"`), where your React components will be rendered.

2. **src/components/**:
   - This folder contains **all reusable components**. Each component (like `ProductCard`, `ProductGallery`, and `ShoppingCart`) is kept in its own file. These files are JSX files because they contain both JavaScript logic and HTML-like structure.

3. **src/App.jsx**:
   - This is the main component of the app. It will "call" (import and use) the components like `ProductCard`, `ProductGallery`, and `ShoppingCart` to display them on the page.

4. **src/index.js**:
   - This is the entry point of the React application. It renders the `App.jsx` component into the `div` with the ID `root` inside the `public/index.html` file.

### Example code for each part:

- **App.jsx**:
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import ProductCard from './components/ProductCard';
    import ProductGallery from './components/ProductGallery';
    import ShoppingCart from './components/ShoppingCart';

    const App = () => {
        return (
            <div>
                <h1>My E-Commerce Store</h1>
                <ProductGallery />
                <ProductCard />
                <ShoppingCart />
            </div>
        );
    };

    export default App;
    ```

- **ProductCard.jsx**:
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';

    const ProductCard = () => {
        return <div>Product Card Component</div>;
    };

    export default ProductCard;
    ```

- **ProductGallery.jsx**:
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';

    const ProductGallery = () => {
        return <div>Product Gallery Component</div>;
    };

    export default ProductGallery;
    ```

- **ShoppingCart.jsx**:
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';

    const ShoppingCart = () => {
        return <div>Shopping Cart Component</div>;
    };

    export default ShoppingCart;
    ```

### Summary:
- **Components are in the `src/components/` folder** to keep them organized.
- **`App.jsx` "calls" the components** by importing them and then using them in its JSX.
- The project structure helps students see the logical separation of concerns: each feature is in its own component, and the main app brings everything together.

This structure is simple but effective for a beginner's React project, and it will help your students understand the modular nature of React components.
