# Optional Exercise 2: Designing an Accessible Checkout Form

### Overview

In this voluntary exercise, you will design an **accessible checkout form** for an e-commerce website. The goal is to ensure that users of all abilities can easily and efficiently complete the checkout process, a key aspect of any e-commerce platform. Accessibility is vital to making the web inclusive, and this exercise will introduce you to some of the best practices to achieve that.

### Learning Objectives

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand the importance of accessibility in web design.
- Learn how to create form elements that are compliant with accessibility standards (e.g., ARIA attributes, proper labeling).
- Gain hands-on experience implementing an accessible, user-friendly checkout process.
  
### Instructions

1. **Create the Form Structure**
   - Build a semantic HTML structure for the checkout form. Include fields for **name**, **address**, **email**, **credit card information**, and a **submit button**.

2. **Make It Accessible**
   - Ensure that all form fields are properly labeled.
   - Use accessible attributes such as `aria-label`, `aria-required`, and `tabindex` to make form navigation intuitive for users with screen readers.
   - Implement visible focus states for users navigating with a keyboard.
   - Ensure color contrast meets accessibility standards.
   
3. **Validation & Error Messages**
   - Add inline form validation. If a field is invalid, display a clear and descriptive error message.
   - Ensure that error messages are announced by screen readers when a form field fails validation.

4. **Responsive Design**
   - Make sure the form is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.

### Bonus Tips

- Test the form using keyboard navigation and screen readers (e.g., NVDA, VoiceOver).
- Implement **skip links** to help users easily navigate through the form.
  
### Code Example

Here is a simple skeleton to get you started:

```html
<form action="/submit-checkout" method="POST" aria-labelledby="checkoutForm">
  <fieldset>
    <legend id="checkoutForm">Checkout Form</legend>

    <label for="name">Full Name</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required aria-required="true" aria-label="Full Name" />

    <label for="address">Address</label>
    <input type="text" id="address" name="address" required aria-required="true" aria-label="Address" />

    <label for="email">Email</label>
    <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required aria-required="true" aria-label="Email Address" />

    <label for="cc-info">Credit Card Information</label>
    <input type="text" id="cc-info" name="cc-info" required aria-required="true" aria-label="Credit Card Information" />

    <button type="submit">Complete Purchase</button>

    <div role="alert" aria-live="polite" id="error-message" style="display:none;">
      <!-- Error messages will appear here -->
    </div>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```
